# FYS-2021

In the folder assignment_1 you will find my code.

In this assignment there has been written a code that seperates pop and classical music samples, divides them into training and testing data so that the program can learn from the data.
The goal was to feed the program training data and then test it with the testing data to see how well it could classify the different samples. A decision boundary is made based on the training data and this is how the program classifies the different samples.
